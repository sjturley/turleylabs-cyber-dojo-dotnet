1. Use the code in a test harness by creating an instance of the Customer class and calling the statement method on that instance.
2. Deal with the irritating dependency by using either the "Wrap and Extend" or "Subclass to Test" techniques we discussed.
3. Decide what is important to verify in your test and pass that value to Approvals.verify.
4. Examine the file generated by Approvals and rename the suffix from *.received.txt to *.approved.txt.
5. Re-run the test to make sure it is now green.
6. Convert your Approvals.verify test into a CombinationApprovals.verifyAllCombinations but start with only a single combination.
7. Run the test, inspect the output, and approve the result.
8. Add more combinations until all branches of the code are fully covered.
9. Test mutations by finding places in the production code to modify. Do your tests fail when you break the production code? If they do not fail, they are not sufficient yet.
